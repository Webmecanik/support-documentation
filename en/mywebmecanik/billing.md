# Billing

## Introduction ##

myWebmecanik will automatically issue an monthly invoice according to the terms of your contract (i.e. based on number of valid email-records and instances).

## Billing method ##

myWebmecanik requests your credit card details (CB) to issue the invoices and proceed to payment.

**NOTE** : In case of annual upfront payment, you’ll benefit from 2 months free. Invoices will be issued for supplementary use, based on the term of your contract (i.e. based on number of valid email-records and instances).
