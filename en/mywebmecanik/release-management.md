# Managing Webmecanik Automation Update Releases

## Introduction

You now have the ability to choose the update schedule for your instances of Webmecanik Automation, as well as determine who will receive the update newsletters from Webmecanik.

## Choose The Update Activation Date

When a new version of Webmecanik Automation is due to be released you will receive an email summary of the new features that will come with it.

On the myWebmecanik menu to the left, you should have an “Update Management” option that will display all of your deployed instances. For each one, you have a dropdown box to the right which will display the available update periods. Simply click the time period that you desire and the changes will be automatically saved.

## Choose the email addresses that will receive email updates

It may be the case that you wish to delay or stop the sending of update information to your clients. To this end, it is important to note that by default:

•    **myWebmecanik users are the sole recipients of the update newsletters**

•    Otherwise, if you want your clients to receive update newsletters in real time, simply click on the client’s name when you are on the myWebmecanik dashboard, scroll to the bottom of the “Contacts” section, then tick the “I agree to receive the Update Information Newsletters” option.
